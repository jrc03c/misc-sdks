# Intro

This is a little library of SDKs for various APIs that I use at work. They're intentionally minimalistic and not intended to cover the entire surface area of every API they target.

# Installation

```bash
npm install @jrc03c/misc-sdks
```

# Usage

```js
import {
  AirtableClient,
  BaseClient,
  MailTmClient,
  MailchimpClient,
} from "@jrc03c/misc-sdks"
```
