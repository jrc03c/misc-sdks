A Mail.tm email address and password is required to be able to use this library. You can acquire a set of credentials simply by visiting https://mail.tm and copying the current email address and password. (Since Mail.tm is a disposable email service, you don't "sign up" for an account in the usual way. Instead, accounts are created when you visit the website and/or when you click the "Sign out" button.)
